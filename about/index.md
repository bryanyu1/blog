Hi! My name is Bryan Yu, and welcome to my blog!

<p><img src="https://github.com/bryanyu1/blog/tree/gh-pages/assets/images/bryan-garibadli.jpeg" alt="Bryan Yu"/></p>

I am currently a undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario, Canada. I am studying mathematics and business administration simultaneously at each aforementioned university respectively, majoring in statistics and finance. My career goal is to become a data scientist and/or quantitative modeller. From the outside, it may seem that academics and my professional life define who I am. However, academics are not the only aspect of my life. I am also an avid traveller, hiker, and fitness enthusiast. 

My dream is to be a lifelong learner and explorer. This goal applies to my academic, professional, and extracurricular lives. I wish to explore advanced statistical/financial problems and new places concurrently. This blog is a recollection of all the photos and journeys I experience in my life of travel and exploration. I wish to share the beautiful places and people that I meet on my travels. I hope to inspire people to explore the great outdoors and see the beautiful landscapes that the world has to offer. 

Finally, I would like to personally thank you for visiting my blog. I hope I can inspire you to go outside and explore!
