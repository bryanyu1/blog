Hi everyone! My name is Bryan Yu, and this is officially my first post and website I have ever created. 

As a quick introduction, I am a Mathematics and Business Student at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario, Canada. The main focuses of my academics are in Statistics and Finance. I know what you are thinking, how did a STEM student end up becoming a travel and fitness blog writer and photographer? Over the years, I have realized that my life is so much more than just my academics and professional work. I have a passion for fitness and exploring new places. From chasing sunsets and sunrises to exploring new cultures and cities worldwide, I love it all. This blog is just a small snippet of my adventures around the world and my fitness journey to becoming a healthier and more well-rounded person. Please feel free to peruse my writing and photography. I hope you can relive the happiest moments of my journey, and I can inspire you to travel and explore with me!
