My favourite hike thus far has gotta be the tea house hike at Lake Louise in Alberta, Canada!

Here are some of my favourite photos from the hike. Enjoy!


Before the hike, I had an amazing view of Lake Louise at sunrise.

During the hike, I took several photos of the surrounding scenary.

The first tea house is located beside Lake Agnes. What an absolutely stunning lake!

On the hike to the second tea house, I took my favourite photo of Lake Louise: a complete view of the entire lake and the Fairmont with a stunning reflection of the clouds.

The second tea house is beside the Plain of Six Glaciers and absolutely beautiful as well!
